## Development Workflow

### Adding or Editing Skills

1. **Edit the source files** in `/skills/`:
   ```bash
   # Edit an existing skill
   vim skills/work-on-ticket/SKILL.md
   
   # Or create a new skill
   mkdir skills/my-new-skill
   vim skills/my-new-skill/SKILL.md
   ```

2. **Update plugin manifests** to include your skill:
   ```bash
   vim plugins/zapier-eng-plugin/manifest.json
   ```
   
   Add your skill to the `skills` array:
   ```json
   {
     "skills": [
       "work-on-ticket",
       "my-new-skill"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Rebuild plugins**:
   ```bash
   make build-all
   ```

4. **Test your changes** with Claude or your MCP client

### Adding or Editing Commands

1. **Edit the source files** in `/commands/`:
   ```bash
   # Edit an existing command
   vim commands/eng/chore.md
   
   # Or create a new command
   mkdir -p commands/product
   vim commands/product/roadmap.md
   ```

2. **Update plugin manifests** to include your command:
   ```bash
   vim plugins/zapier-eng-plugin/manifest.json
   ```
   
   Add your command to the `commands` array:
   ```json
   {
     "commands": [
       "eng/chore",
       "product/roadmap"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Rebuild plugins**:
   ```bash
   make build-all
   ```

### Creating a New Plugin

1. **Create the plugin directory structure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p plugins/my-plugin/skills
   mkdir -p plugins/my-plugin/commands
   ```

2. **Create a manifest.json**:
   ```bash
   cat > plugins/my-plugin/manifest.json << 'EOF'
   {
     "name": "my-plugin",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "Description of what this plugin does",
     "skills": [
       "work-on-ticket"
     ],
     "commands": [
       "eng/chore"
     ]
   }
   EOF
   ```

3. **Build the plugin**:
   ```bash
   make build PLUGIN=my-plugin
   ```

4. **Test the plugin** with your MCP client

## Important Rules

### ⚠️ DO NOT Edit Plugin Files Directly

**Never edit files in `plugins/*/skills/` or `plugins/*/commands/`** - these are generated and gitignored.

❌ **Wrong:**
```bash
vim plugins/zapier-eng-plugin/skills/work-on-ticket/SKILL.md
```

✅ **Correct:**
```bash
vim skills/work-on-ticket/SKILL.md
make build-all
```

### ✅ Always Rebuild After Changes

After editing any skill or command:

```bash
make build-all
```

Or for a specific plugin:

```bash
make build PLUGIN=zapier-eng-plugin
```

### 📝 Update Documentation

When adding new skills or plugins:

1. Update `skills/README.md` if adding a new skill
2. Update `plugins/README.md` if adding a new plugin
3. Update `skills/CLAUDE.md` if adding new trigger patterns

## Skill Development Guidelines

### Skill Structure

Each skill should have:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Main skill instructions (required)
├── references/       # Additional docs (optional)
└── scripts/          # Executable code (optional)
```

### SKILL.md Format

Use YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: Skill Name
description: Brief description that includes trigger phrases
allowed-tools: Tool1, Tool2
license: MIT
metadata:
  author: Your Name
  version: 1.0.0
  mcp-server: zapier
---

# Skill Name

Full skill documentation...
```

### Trigger Patterns

Add trigger patterns to `skills/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
| Trigger | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| "your trigger phrase", "alternative phrase" | `your-skill-name` |
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Build the plugin: `make build PLUGIN=zapier-eng-plugin`
2. Install the plugin in Claude/your MCP client
3. Test the trigger phrases
4. Verify the workflow executes correctly

### Automated Testing

(Coming soon)

## Useful Make Commands
